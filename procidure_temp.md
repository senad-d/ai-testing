# Creating a _____ in _______ using a GPT-4o and r1

Here are the steps I took to create a ______ in _______ using the latest DeapSeek R1 model and ChatGPT 4o model:

1. I enhanced my prompt using GPT.
2. Then, I created a plan with the R1 model.
3. I provided the new plan to GPT to generate the code.
4. After that, I asked GPT to fix some bugs.
5. Next, I created a plan for improving the code with the R1 model.
6. Finally, I requested GPT to update the code.

I tested the game, and it works perfectly.

You can find all of prompts in `.continue/promprts` directory.

#### 1\. I enhanced my prompt using GPT.

**Input**
```

```

#### 2\. Then, I created a plan with the R1 model.

**Input**
```

```

**Output R1**
```

```

#### 3\. I provided the new plan to GPT to generate the code based on the design and rules specified above.

**Input**
```
@CreateFromPlan
```

**Output GPT**
```

```

#### 4\. After that, I asked GPT to fix some bugs.

**Input**
```

```

**Output GPT**
```

```

```

## 5\. Next, I created a plan for improving the code with the R1 model.

**Input**
```

```

**Output R1**
```

```

## 6\. Finally, I requested GPT to update the code.
